# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Caveman frontmatter for subagents** — agent files can now set boolean `caveman` frontmatter to ask the caveman extension RPC to apply or remove caveman prompt text before child session creation. Runs are tagged as `caveman:on`, `caveman:off`, or `caveman:unavailable` for UI/status display.
- **Caveman RPC warning handling** — invalid `caveman` frontmatter, unavailable RPC, or apply failures are reported as non-fatal warnings; foreground runs can show warning notifications while agents continue with the unmodified prompt.

### Changed
- **No embedded default agents** — the extension no longer ships `general-purpose`, `Explore`, or `Plan`. Users must define agent types in `.pi/agents/<name>.md` or `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`; unknown types now return setup guidance instead of falling back.

### Fixed
- **pi 0.68.x SDK compatibility** — subagent sessions now pass an explicit cwd into `SettingsManager.create()` and register subagent bridge tools via `customTools` while using the pi 0.68+ string-name tool allowlist contract. This fixes runtime breakage when loading the extension under newer host pi versions.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Package renamed** — published package name is now `@yzlin/pi-subagents`.
- **Fork metadata aligned** — package metadata and README now point to the `yzlin/pi-subagents` fork for repository, homepage, issues, and media assets.
- **Original author credit added** — README and package metadata now explicitly credit [tintinweb](https://github.com/tintinweb) as the original author.
- **Conversation viewer paging aliases** — in the running-agent detail overlay, `Ctrl+F` now matches Page Down and `Ctrl+B` now matches Page Up, consistent with the existing modal navigation aliases.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Extension `session_start` handlers now fire in subagent sessions** ([#20](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/20)) — `bindExtensions()` was never called on subagent sessions, so extensions that initialize state in `session_start` (e.g. loading credentials, setting up connections) silently failed at runtime. Tools appeared registered but were non-functional. Now calls `session.bindExtensions()` after tool filtering and before prompting, matching the lifecycle used by pi's interactive, print, and RPC modes. Also triggers `extendResourcesFromExtensions("startup")` so extension-provided skills and prompts are discovered.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Agent config is authoritative** — frontmatter values for `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, `inherit_context`, `run_in_background`, `isolated`, and `isolation` now take precedence over `Agent` tool-call parameters. Tool-call params only fill fields the agent config leaves unspecified.
- **`join_mode` is now a global setting only** — removed the per-call `join_mode` parameter from the `Agent` tool. Join behavior is configured via `/agents` → Settings → Join mode.
- **`max_turns: 0` means unlimited** — agent files can now explicitly set `max_turns: 0` to lock unlimited turns. Previously `0` was silently clamped to `1`.

### Fixed
- **Final subagent text preserved from non-streaming providers** — agents using providers that return the final message without streaming `text_delta` events no longer return empty results. Falls back to extracting text from the completed session history.
- **`effectiveMaxTurns` passed to spawn calls** — previously `params.max_turns` was passed raw to both foreground and background spawn, bypassing the agent config entirely.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **RPC stop handler** — new `subagents:rpc:stop` event bus RPC allows other extensions to stop running subagents by agent ID. Returns structured error ("Agent not found") on failure.
- **`abort` in `SpawnCapable` interface** — cross-extension RPC consumers can now stop agents, not just spawn them.
- **Live turn counter** — all agents now show a live turn count in the widget, inline result, and completion notification. With a turn limit: `⟳5≤30` (5 of 30 turns). Without: `⟳5`. Updates in real time as turns progress via `onTurnEnd` callback.
- **Biome linting** — added [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for correctness linting (unused imports, suspicious patterns). Style rules disabled. Run `npm run lint` to check, `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix.
- **CI workflow** — GitHub Actions runs lint, typecheck, and tests on push to master and PRs.
- **Auto-trigger parent turn on background completion** — background agent completion notifications now use `triggerTurn: true`, automatically prompting the parent agent to process results instead of waiting for user input.

### Changed
- **Standardized RPC envelope** — cross-extension RPC handlers (`ping`, `spawn`, `stop`) now use a `handleRpc` wrapper that emits structured envelopes (`{ success: true, data }` / `{ success: false, error }`), matching pi-mono's `RpcResponse` convention.
- **Protocol versioning via ping** — ping reply now includes `{ version: PROTOCOL_VERSION }` (currently v2). Callers can detect version mismatches and warn users to update.
- **Default max turns is now unlimited** — subagents no longer have a 50-turn default cap. The default is unlimited (no turn limit), matching Claude Code's main loop behavior. Users can still set explicit limits per-agent via `max_turns` frontmatter or the Agent tool parameter, or globally via `/agents` → Settings (`0` = unlimited).
- **Stale dist in published package** — added `prepublishOnly` hook to build fresh `dist/` on every `npm publish`.

### Fixed
- **Tool name display** — `getAgentConversation` now reads `ToolCall.name` (the correct property) instead of `toolName`, resolving `[Tool: unknown]` in conversation viewer and verbose output.
- **Env test CI failure** — `detectEnv` test assumed a branch name exists, but CI checks out detached HEAD. Split into separate tests for repo detection and branch detection with a controlled temp repo.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Conversation viewer crash in narrow terminals** ([#7](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/issues/7)) — `buildContentLines()` in the live conversation viewer could return lines wider than the terminal when `wrapTextWithAnsi()` misjudged visible width on ANSI-heavy input (e.g. tool output with embedded escape codes, long URLs, wide tables). All content lines are now clamped with `truncateToWidth()` before returning. Same class of bug as the widget fix in v0.2.7, different component.

### Added
- **Conversation viewer width-safety tests** — 17 tests covering `render()` and `buildContentLines()` across varied content (plain text, ANSI codes, unicode, tables, long URLs, narrow terminals). Includes mock-based regression tests that simulate upstream `wrapTextWithAnsi` returning overwidth lines, ensuring the safety net catches them.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Cross-extension RPC** — other pi extensions can spawn subagents via `pi.events` event bus (`subagents:rpc:ping`, `subagents:rpc:spawn`). Emits `subagents:ready` on load.
- **Session persistence for agent records** — completed agent records are persisted via `pi.appendEntry("subagents:record", ...)` for cross-extension history reconstruction.

### Fixed
- **Background agent notification race condition** — `pi.sendMessage()` is fire-and-forget, so completion notifications sent eagerly from `onComplete` could not be retracted when `get_subagent_result` was called in the same turn. Notifications are now held behind a 200ms cancellable timer; `get_subagent_result` cancels the pending timer before it fires, eliminating duplicate notifications. Group notifications also re-check `resultConsumed` at send time so consumed agents are filtered out.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Custom notification renderer** — background agent completion notifications now render as styled, themed boxes instead of raw XML. Uses `pi.registerMessageRenderer()` with the `"subagent-notification"` custom message type. The LLM continues to receive `<task-notification>` XML via `content`; only the user-facing display changes.
- **Group notification rendering** — group completions render each agent as its own styled block (icon, description, stats, result preview) instead of showing only the first agent.
- **Output file streaming for background agents** — background agents now get the same output file transcript as foreground agents, with `onSessionCreated` wiring and proper cleanup on completion/error.
- `NotificationDetails` type in `types.ts` — structured details for the notification renderer, with optional `others` array for group notifications.
- `buildNotificationDetails()` helper — extracts renderer-facing details from an `AgentRecord`.

### Changed
- **Notification delivery** — `sendIndividualNudge` and group notification now use `pi.sendMessage()` (custom message) instead of `pi.sendUserMessage()` (plain text), enabling renderer-controlled display.
- **Steered status rendering** — steered agents show "completed (steered)" in the notification box instead of plain "completed".

### Fixed
- **Output file cleanup on completion** — `agent-manager.ts` now calls `record.outputCleanup()` in both the success and error paths of agent completion, ensuring the streaming subscription is flushed and released.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown aborts agents instead of blocking** — `session_shutdown` now calls `abortAll()` instead of `waitForAll()`, so the process exits immediately instead of hanging until all background agents complete. Agent results are undeliverable after shutdown anyway.

### Added
- `abortAll()` method on `AgentManager` — stops all queued and running agents at once, returning the count of affected agents.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **Widget render-once pattern** — the widget callback is now registered once via `setWidget()` and subsequent updates use `requestRender()` instead of re-registering the entire widget on every `update()` call. Eliminates layout thrashing from repeated widget teardown/setup cycles.
- **Status bar dedup** — `setStatus()` is now only called when the status text actually changes, avoiding redundant TUI updates.
- **UICtx change detection** — `setUICtx()` detects context changes and forces widget re-registration, correctly handling session switches.

### Refactored
- Extracted `renderWidget()` private method — moves all widget content rendering out of the `update()` closure into a standalone method that reads live state on each call.
- `update()` is now a lightweight coordinator: counts agents, manages registration lifecycle, and triggers re-renders.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Race condition in `get_subagent_result` with `wait: true`** — `resultConsumed` is now set before `await record.promise`, preventing a redundant follow-up notification. Previously the `onComplete` callback (attached at spawn time via `.then()`) always fired before the await resumed, seeing `resultConsumed` as false.
- **Stale agent records across sessions** — new `clearCompleted()` method removes all completed/stopped/errored agent records on `session_start` and `session_switch` events, so tasks from a prior session don't persist into a new one.
- **`steer_subagent` race on freshly launched agents** — steering an agent before its session initialized silently dropped the message. Now steers are queued on the record and flushed once `onSessionCreated` fires.

### Changed
- Extracted `removeRecord()` private helper in `AgentManager` — deduplicates dispose+delete logic between `cleanup()` and `clearCompleted()`.

### Added
- 8 new tests covering `resultConsumed` race condition and `clearCompleted` behavior (185 total).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Persistent agent memory** — new `memory` frontmatter field with three scopes: `"user"` (global `~/.pi/`), `"project"` (per-project `.pi/`), `"local"` (gitignored `.pi/`). Agents with write/edit tools get full read-write memory; read-only agents get a read-only fallback that injects existing MEMORY.md content without granting write access or creating directories.
- **Git worktree isolation** — new `isolation: "worktree"` frontmatter field and Agent tool parameter. Creates a temporary `git worktree` so agents work on an isolated copy of the repo. On completion, changes are auto-committed to a `pi-agent-<id>` branch; clean worktrees are removed. Includes crash recovery via `pruneWorktrees()`.
- **Skill preloading** — `skills` frontmatter now accepts a comma-separated list of skill names (e.g. `skills: planning, review`). Reads from `.pi/skills/` (project) then `~/.pi/skills/` (global), tries `.md`/`.txt`/bare extensions. Content injected into the system prompt as `# Preloaded Skill: {name}`.
- **Tool denylist** — new `disallowed_tools` frontmatter field (e.g. `disallowed_tools: bash, write`). Blocks specified tools even if `builtinToolNames` or extensions would provide them. Enforced for both extension-enabled and extension-disabled agents.
- **Prompt extras system** — new `PromptExtras` interface in `prompts.ts`; `buildAgentPrompt()` accepts optional memory and skill blocks appended in both `replace` and `append` modes.
- `getMemoryTools()`, `getReadOnlyMemoryTools()` in `agent-types.ts`.
- `buildMemoryBlock()`, `buildReadOnlyMemoryBlock()`, `isSymlink()`, `safeReadFile()` in `memory.ts`.
- `preloadSkills()` in `skill-loader.ts`.
- `createWorktree()`, `cleanupWorktree()`, `pruneWorktrees()` in `worktree.ts`.
- `MemoryScope`, `IsolationMode` types; `memory`, `isolation`, `disallowedTools` fields on `AgentConfig`; `worktree`, `worktreeResult` fields on `AgentRecord`.
- 177 total tests across 8 test files (41 new tests).

### Fixed
- **Read-only agents no longer escalated to read-write** — enabling `memory` on a read-only agent (e.g. Explore) previously auto-added `write`/`edit` tools. Now the runner detects write capability and branches: read-write agents get full memory tools, read-only agents get read-only memory prompt with only the `read` tool added.
- **Denylist-aware memory detection** — write capability check now accounts for `disallowedTools`. An agent with `tools: write` + `disallowed_tools: write` correctly gets read-only memory instead of broken read-write instructions.
- **Worktree requires commits** — repos with no commits (empty HEAD) are now rejected early with a warning instead of failing silently at `git worktree add`.
- **Worktree failure warning** — when worktree creation fails, a warning is prepended to the agent's prompt instead of silently falling through to the main cwd.
- **No force-branch overwrite** — worktree cleanup appends a timestamp suffix on branch name conflict instead of using `git branch -f`.

### Security
- **Whitelist name validation** — agent/skill names must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$`, max 128 chars. Rejects path traversal, leading dots, spaces, and special characters.
- **Symlink protection** — `safeReadFile()` and `isSymlink()` reject symlinks in memory directories, MEMORY.md files, and skill files, preventing arbitrary file reads.
- **Symlink-safe directory creation** — `ensureMemoryDir()` throws on symlinked directories.

### Changed
- `agent-runner.ts`: tool/extension/skill resolution moved before memory detection; `ctx.cwd` → `effectiveCwd` throughout.
- `custom-agents.ts`: extracted `parseCsvField()` helper; added `csvListOptional()` and `parseMemory()`.
- `skill-loader.ts`: uses `safeReadFile()` from `memory.ts` instead of raw `readFileSync`.
- Agent tool schema updated with `isolation` parameter and help text for `memory`, `isolation`, `disallowed_tools`, and skill list.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Event bus** — agent lifecycle events emitted via `pi.events.emit()`, enabling other extensions to react to sub-agent activity:
  - `subagents:created` — background agent registered (includes `id`, `type`, `description`, `isBackground`)
  - `subagents:started` — agent transitions to running (includes queued→running)
  - `subagents:completed` — agent finished successfully (includes `durationMs`, `tokens`, `toolUses`, `result`)
  - `subagents:failed` — agent errored, stopped, or aborted (same payload as completed)
  - `subagents:steered` — steering message sent to a running agent
- `OnAgentStart` callback and `onStart` constructor parameter on `AgentManager`.
- **Cross-package manager** now also exposes `spawn()` and `getRecord()` via the `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` global.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Graceful shutdown in headless mode** — the CLI now waits for all running and queued background agents to complete before exiting (`waitForAll` on `session_shutdown`). Previously, background agents could be silently killed mid-execution when the session ended. Only affects headless/non-interactive mode; interactive sessions already kept the process alive.

### Added
- `hasRunning()` / `waitForAll()` methods on `AgentManager`.
- **Cross-package manager access** — agent manager exposed via `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` on `globalThis` for other extensions to check status or await completion.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **XML-delimited prompt sections** — append-mode agents now wrap inherited content in `<inherited_system_prompt>`, `<sub_agent_context>`, and `<agent_instructions>` XML tags, giving the model explicit structure to distinguish inherited rules from sub-agent-specific instructions. Replace mode is unchanged.
- **Token count in agent results** — foreground agent results, background completion notifications, and `get_subagent_result` now include the token count alongside tool uses and duration (e.g. `Agent completed in 4.2s (12 tool uses, 33.8k token)`).
- **Widget overflow cap** — the running agents widget now caps at 12 lines. When exceeded, running agents are prioritized over finished ones and an overflow summary line shows hidden counts (e.g. `+3 more (1 running, 2 finished)`).

### Changed - **changing behavior**
- **General-purpose agent inherits parent prompt** — the default `general-purpose` agent now uses `promptMode: "append"` with an empty system prompt, making it a "parent twin" that inherits the full parent system prompt (including CLAUDE.md rules, project conventions, and safety guardrails). Previously it used a standalone prompt that duplicated a subset of the parent's rules. Explore and Plan are unchanged (standalone prompts). To customize: eject via `/agents` → select `general-purpose` → Eject, then edit the resulting `.md` file. Set `prompt_mode: replace` to go back to a standalone prompt, or keep `prompt_mode: append` and add extra instructions in the body.
- **Append-mode agents receive parent system prompt** — `buildAgentPrompt` now accepts the parent's system prompt and threads it into append-mode agents (env header + parent prompt + sub-agent context bridge + optional custom instructions). Replace-mode agents are unchanged.
- **Prompt pipeline simplified** — removed `systemPromptOverride`/`systemPromptAppend` from `SpawnOptions` and `RunOptions`. These were a separate code path where `index.ts` pre-resolved the prompt mode and passed raw strings into the runner, bypassing `buildAgentPrompt`. Now all prompt assembly flows through `buildAgentPrompt` using the agent's `promptMode` config — one code path, no special cases.

### Removed
- Deprecated backwards-compat aliases: `registerCustomAgents`, `getCustomAgentConfig`, `getCustomAgentNames` (use `registerAgents`, `getAgentConfig`, `getUserAgentNames`).
- `resolveCustomPrompt()` helper in index.ts — no longer needed now that prompt routing is config-driven.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Live conversation viewer** — selecting a running (or completed) agent in `/agents` → "Running agents" now opens a scrollable overlay showing the agent's full conversation in real time. Auto-scrolls to follow new content; scroll up to pause, End to resume. Press Esc to close.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Case-insensitive agent type lookup** — `"explore"`, `"EXPLORE"`, and `"Explore"` all resolve to the same agent. LLMs frequently lowercase type names; this prevents validation failures.
- **Unknown type fallback** — unrecognized agent types fall back to `general-purpose` with a note, instead of hard-rejecting. Matches Claude Code behavior.
- **Dynamic tool list for general-purpose** — `builtinToolNames` is now optional in `AgentConfig`. When omitted, the agent gets all tools from `TOOL_FACTORIES` at lookup time, so new tools added upstream are automatically available.
- **Agent source indicators in `/agents` menu** — `•` (project), `◦` (global), `✕` (disabled) with legend. Defaults are unmarked.
- **Disabled agents visible in UI** — disabled agents now show in the "Agent types" list (marked `✕`) with an Enable action, instead of being invisible.
- **Enable action** — re-enable a disabled agent from the `/agents` menu. Stub files are auto-cleaned.
- **Disable action for all agent types** — custom and ejected default agents can now be disabled from the UI, not just built-in defaults.
- `resolveType()` export — case-insensitive type name resolution for external use.
- `getAllTypes()` export — returns all agent names including disabled (for UI listing).
- `source` field on `AgentConfig` — tracks where an agent was loaded from (`"default"`, `"project"`, `"global"`).

### Fixed
- **Model resolver checks auth for exact matches** — `resolveModel("anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")` now fails gracefully when no Anthropic API key is configured, instead of returning a model that errors at the API call. Explore silently falls back to the parent model on non-Anthropic setups.

### Changed
- **Unified agent registry** — built-in and custom agents now use the same `AgentConfig` type and a single registry. No more separate code paths for built-in vs custom agents.
- **Default agents are overridable** — creating a `.md` file with the same name as a default agent (e.g. `.pi/agents/Explore.md`) overrides it.
- **`/agents` menu** — "Agent types" list shows defaults and custom agents together with source indicators. Default agents get Eject/Disable actions; overridden defaults get Reset to default.
- **Eject action** — export a default agent's embedded config as a `.md` file to project or personal location for customization.
- **Model labels** — provider-agnostic: strips `provider/` prefix and `-YYYYMMDD` date suffix (e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` → `claude-haiku-4-5`). Works for any provider.
- **New frontmatter fields** — `display_name` (UI display name) and `enabled` (default: true; set to false to disable).
- **Menu navigation** — Esc in agent detail returns to agent list (not main menu).

### Removed
- **`statusline-setup` and `claude-code-guide` agents** — removed as built-in types (never spawned programmatically). Users can recreate them as custom agents if needed.
- `BuiltinSubagentType` union type, `SUBAGENT_TYPES` array, `DISPLAY_NAMES` map, `SubagentTypeConfig` interface — replaced by unified `AgentConfig`.
- `buildSystemPrompt()` switch statement — replaced by config-driven `buildAgentPrompt()`.
- `HAIKU_MODEL_IDS` fallback array — Explore's haiku default is now just the `model` field in its config.
- `BUILTIN_MODEL_LABELS` — model labels now derived from config.
- `ALL_TOOLS` hardcoded constant — general-purpose now derives tools dynamically.

### Added
- `src/default-agents.ts` — embedded default configs for general-purpose, Explore, and Plan.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Widget crash in narrow terminals** — agent widget lines were not truncated to terminal width, causing `doRender` to throw when the tmux pane was narrower than the rendered content. All widget lines are now truncated using `truncateToWidth()` with the actual terminal column count.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Background task join strategies** — smart grouping of background agent completion notifications
  - `smart` (default): 2+ background agents spawned in the same turn are auto-grouped into a single consolidated notification instead of individual nudges
  - `async`: each agent notifies individually on completion (previous behavior)
  - `group`: force grouping even for solo agents
  - 30s timeout after first completion delivers partial results; 15s straggler re-batch window for remaining agents
- **`join_mode` parameter** on the `Agent` tool — override join strategy per agent (`"async"` or `"group"`)
- **Join mode setting** in `/agents` → Settings — configure the default join mode at runtime
- New `src/group-join.ts` — `GroupJoinManager` class for batched completion notifications

### Changed
- `AgentRecord` now includes optional `groupId`, `joinMode`, and `resultConsumed` fields
- Background agent completion routing refactored: individual nudge logic extracted to `sendIndividualNudge()`, group delivery via `GroupJoinManager`

### Fixed
- **Debounce window race** — agents that complete during the 100ms batch debounce window are now deferred and retroactively fed into the group once it's registered, preventing split notifications (one individual + one partial group) and zombie groups
- **Solo agent swallowed notification** — if only one agent was spawned (no group formed) but it completed during the debounce window, its deferred notification is now sent when the batch finalizes
- **Duplicate notifications after polling** — calling `get_subagent_result` on a completed agent now marks its result as consumed, suppressing the subsequent completion notification (both individual and group)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Interactive `/agents` menu** — single command replaces `/agent` and `/agents` with a full management wizard
  - Browse and manage running agents
  - Custom agents submenu — edit or delete existing agents
  - Create new custom agents via manual wizard or AI-generated (with comprehensive frontmatter documentation for the generator)
  - Settings: configure max concurrency, default max turns, and grace turns at runtime
  - Built-in agent types shown with model info (e.g. `Explore · haiku`)
  - Aligned formatting for agent lists
- **Configurable turn limits** — `defaultMaxTurns` and `graceTurns` are now runtime-adjustable via `/agents` → Settings
- Sub-menus return to main menu instead of exiting

### Removed
- `/agent <type> <prompt>` command (use `Agent` tool directly, or create custom agents via `/agents`)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Global custom agents** — agents in `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` are now discovered automatically and available across all projects
- Two-tier discovery hierarchy: project-level (`.pi/agents/`) overrides global (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Screenshot in README

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Renamed package to `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`
- Fuzzy model resolver now only matches models with auth configured (prevents selecting unconfigured providers)
- Custom agents hot-reload on each `Agent` tool call (no restart needed for new `.pi/agents/*.md` files)
- Updated pi dependencies to 0.56.1

### Refactored
- Extracted `createActivityTracker()` — eliminates duplicated tool activity wiring between foreground and background paths
- Extracted `safeFormatTokens()` — replaces 4 repeated try-catch blocks
- Extracted `buildDetails()` — consolidates AgentDetails construction
- Extracted `getStatusLabel()` / `getStatusNote()` — consolidates 3 duplicated status formatting chains
- Shared `extractText()` — consolidated duplicate from context.ts and agent-runner.ts
- Added `ERROR_STATUSES` constant in widget for consistent status checks
- `getDisplayName()` now delegates to `getConfig()` instead of separate lookups
- Removed unused `Tool` type export from agent-types

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Persistent above-editor widget** — tree view of all running/queued/finished agents with animated spinners and live stats
- **Concurrency queue** — configurable max concurrent background agents (default: 4), auto-drain
- **Queued agents** collapsed to single summary line in widget
- **Turn-based widget linger** — completed agents clear after 1 turn, errors/aborted linger for 2 extra turns
- **Colored status icons** — themed rendering via `setWidget` callback form (`✓` green, `✓` yellow, `✗` red, `■` dim)
- **Live response streaming** — `onTextDelta` shows truncated agent response text instead of static "thinking..."

### Changed
- Tool names match Claude Code: `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, `steer_subagent`
- Labels use "Agent" / "Agents" (not "Subagent")
- Widget heading: `●` when active, `○` when only lingering finished agents
- Extracted all UI code to `src/ui/agent-widget.ts`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Claude Code-style UI rendering** — `renderCall`/`renderResult`/`onUpdate` for live streaming progress
  - Live activity descriptions: "searching, reading 3 files…"
  - Token count display: "33.8k token"
  - Per-agent tool use counter
  - Expandable completed results (ctrl+o)
  - Distinct states: running, background, completed, error, aborted
- **Async environment detection** — replaced `execSync` with `pi.exec()` for non-blocking git/platform detection
- **Status bar integration** — running background agent count shown in pi's status bar
- **Fuzzy model selection** — `"haiku"`, `"sonnet"` resolve to best matching available model

### Changed
- Tool label changed from "Spawn Agent" to "Agent" (matches Claude Code style)
- `onToolUse` callback replaced with richer `onToolActivity` (includes tool name + start/end)
- `onSessionCreated` callback for accessing session stats (token counts)
- `env.ts` now requires `ExtensionAPI` parameter (async `pi.exec()` instead of `execSync`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-05
